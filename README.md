# Linguistics-of-Science
Unspoken requirements for communicating in the sciences. This list of criteria has been compiled over a number of years by Onri Jay Benally on a private cloud database. The inspiration for this public repository comes from the use of a platform called Google Keep (https://keep.google.com), where ideas and thoughts are recorded.

It is similar to the use of Google Docs or Google Sheets in that you can find it on the upper right corner of the Google homepage.

• All about the use of independent sentences (phrases), analogies, adjectives, and even metaphors.

• No fear of repeating the explanation in more ways than one.

• Acknowledge that some terms tend to be used interchangeably, however, their differences should be highlighted. Also, show that it is possible to associate keywords with different processes. Ex: phonon propogation = associated with sound waves or crystal lattice vibrations.

• In math-related work, preferring the use of "out of" instead of "over" when talking about fractions or numerator(s)/denominator(s). Usage of "something" out of one unit of some denominator or group of denominators.

• Provision of immediate examples.

• Attributing descriptors or adjectives as pre-terms before the actual use of a word. Ex: excitatory stimulation with high KCl delivery. Another ex: inhibitory stimulation with TTX delivery.

• A new discovery tends to show its face beginning with the phrase "unless...".

• "Much less information is, however, available on..." can be used to express acknowledgement of limited information about a topic or sub-tropic.

• When displaying images of objects, be sure to draw a scale bar using a reference of known distances near the object(s) being shown.

• Providing clarity by stating why something is important: "this" = advantageous vs. "that" = disadvangeous.
